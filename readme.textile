h1. Elexis 3 Core Repository

*IMPORTANT* Please employ the @3lexisFormatterProfile.xml@ as Eclipse default formatter prior to development and pull requests.
This accounts for all Elexis 3 related development.

h2. Install latest build

Go to "Jenkins-CI Builds":https://srv.elexis.info/jenkins/view/3.0/job/Elexis-3.0-Core/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/ch.elexis.core.p2site/target/products/. Download and unzip the zip file for your machine.

Install Oracle java 1.8 from "http://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp":http://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp

Start the Elexis3 application.


h2. Building

You need Java 1.8+. Maven 3.0.5. Then you should be able to generate the application and p2 update site using the following calls:

@git clone https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-core@
@cd elexis-3-core@
@mvn clean verify -Drepo_variant=release@

Remarks:
* We use verify and not install as target, as we do not push our jars to a maven repository, but let the Jenkins-CI jobs copy the generated the *p2site\target\repository to a subdirectory reachable under http://download.elexis.info/
* Add `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` if you want to skip running the unit tests.
* -Drepo_variant=release as starting with branch 3.3 we begin to use the P2 named like http://download.elexis.info/elexis/<branch-name>/ and use branch names likes 3.3, 3.4.

It will be built for your OS/Window-System/Architecture combination. You will find the executables under @ch.elexis.core.p2site/target/products/ch.elexis.core.application.ElexisApp/*/*/*@
